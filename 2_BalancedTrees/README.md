Animal Farm 4 - Sorting
=================
In this lab, we will learn to sort singly linked lists and create binary search trees.

---

How to do this lab:

Use `git` to clone a copy of the repo... and start coding.

  - We will be implementing:
    - Bubble Sort on Singly Linked Lists
    - Binary Search Trees and helper functions.
  - The header files are ready, and it will be your job to write the cpp files.
We will iterate through, create a class -> check implementation through main_*.cpp -> start over  with next class.
